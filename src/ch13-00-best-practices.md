# Best practices

Clarity is limited by design but still very flexibility in execution. There are
many different ways to implement something that is functionally equivalent. We
all know though, that functional equivalence does not mean runtime cost
equivalence. No programming language book would be complete without discussing
some best practices. All programming languages have their own patterns, common
traps, and other caveats developers ought to consider.
