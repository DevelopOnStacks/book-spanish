# Practice projects

This chapter contains three practice projects to further hone your skills. They
will cover different concepts and Clarity features.

- The [time-locked wallet](ch08-01-time-locked-wallet.md) project provides a
  nice introduction to how blockchains change over time. You will use the block
  height (the length of the chain) to create a contract that unlocks when an
  amount of time has passed.
- The [smart-claimant](ch08-02-smart-claimant.md) is a follow-up project to
  illustrate how inter-contract calls work and how you can you can build on top
  of other smart contracts.
- Finally, the [multi-signature vault](ch08-03-multi-signature-vault.md) project
  teaches you how to build a basic voting mechanism and how to iterate over
  sequences.
